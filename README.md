# American-Sign-Language_MNIST
 Final project for COGS 225 @ UCSD by Maria F. Harris and Roumen Guha.
 
 For a brief overview of the project, look at the [Final Project Presentation](https://github.com/roumenguha/American-Sign-Language_MNIST/blob/master/COGS 225 Final Project Presentation.pdf).
 
 For an in-depth look at what we did and our accomplishments, look at 
 
 Implemented an ASL detector in PyTorch via transfer learning on ResNet50 and VGG16. This was done in the [Transfer Learning in PyTorch](https://github.com/roumenguha/American-Sign-Language_MNIST/blob/master/Transfer Learning in PyTorch.ipynb) notebook. 
 
 Used the generated model to implement a live detector in OpenCV. This was done in the [Live Gesture Detector](https://github.com/roumenguha/American-Sign-Language_MNIST/blob/master/Live Gesture Detector.ipynb) notebook.
