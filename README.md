 For an in-depth look at what we did and our accomplishments, look at the [Final Project Report](https://github.com/roumenguha/American-Sign-Language_MNIST/blob/master/COGS%20225%20Final%20Project%20Report.pdf).
 
 Implemented an ASL detector in PyTorch via transfer learning on ResNet50 and VGG16. This was done in the [Transfer Learning in PyTorch](https://github.com/roumenguha/American-Sign-Language_MNIST/blob/master/Transfer%20Learning%20in%20PyTorch.ipynb) notebook. 
 
 Used the generated model to implement a live detector in OpenCV. This was done in the [Live Gesture Detector](https://github.com/roumenguha/American-Sign-Language_MNIST/blob/master/Live%20Gesture%20Detector.ipynb) notebook.
